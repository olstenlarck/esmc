## Table of Contents

## Install
This project requires [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org) **{%= engines.node %}**. Install it using [**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com) or [**npm**](https://npmjs.com).  
_We highly recommend to use Yarn when you think to contribute to this project._

```bash
$ yarn add {%= name %}

# or globally
$ yarn global add {%= name %}
```

## Usage
<!-- {%= maybeInclude('docs/API.md') %} -->

1. Put your files in `src/`
2. Run it easily with `esmc`
3. Done.

Basically it creates:

- `dist/nodejs` folder for Node.js 8.9 
  + or any passed version to `ESMC_NODE_VERSION` environment variable
  + pass `dist/nodejs/index.js` to your `pkg.module` field, if you are not using `--no-esm` flag
- `dist/browsers` folder for `>= 1%, not dead, not IE <= 11, last 1 Opera versions` browsers
  + or anything passed to `ESMC_BROWSERSLIST` environment variable
  + pass `dist/browsers/index.js` to your favorite bundler
- `dist/nodejs/__index.js` using [esm][], so you can just use it in CJS
  + pass it to your `pkg.main` field if you are not using `--no-esm` flag,
  + otherwise just pass `dist/nodejs/index.js` there

## Notes

By default does not compiles to CommonJS. That's intentional, because bundlers handles ES Modules great. If you want pure CommonJS pass `--no-esm` flag.

- It's mostly instantaneous, because it compiles only files that are changed
- Babel config is basically externalized as [babel-preset-esmc][]
- Linting is done, based on [eslint-config-esmc][]
- If you love static typing, just pass `--flow` flag and it will run type checking before any compilation phase
- All errors, of any phase, are styled similar to ESLint's `codeframe` reporter, so everything is just freaking awesome
- It does not compiles common tests file patterns (if they are in your source directory)
- To run your files using the same config, you can pass `esmc/register` as `--require` hook
- You can use `esmc lint` to only lint your files, using ESLint
- You can use `esmc build` to only compile your source files, using Babel
- Use `--force` flag to start fresh (it deletes `dist` and cleans up the caches)


To try it out, clone the repo, `yarn install` and run `yarn cli` - this will
compile everything from `example-src/` folder as was described above. 

- Make some lint error and run it `yarn cli` 
- Make some type error there and run `yarn cli --flow`
- Make some build error and run `yarn cli`

You will see that style of all errors are similar to ESLint's `codeframe` reporter.
